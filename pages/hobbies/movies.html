      <h1>I should watch more movies XD</h1>
      <p>
        Similar to
        <a href="./books.html">books</a>, movies are a medium I've struggle to access for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
        Internet and availability limitations make it hard to watch a full movie
        from here :(
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course that doesn't stop me when I really want to watch something,
        but it takes a toll, creating a huge backlog of movies I wanna watch
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Parasyte</li>
        <li>Puss & Boots: The Last Wish</li>
        <li>A Silent Voice / Koe no katachi</li>
        <li>The Shape of Water</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To name a few</p>
      <p>
        From live action to animation. Of course there are many movies I've
        watched in the past especially as a kid and teen
      </p>
      <p>Some of my favorites:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your Name / Kimi no nawa</li>
        <li>Howl's Moving Castle</li>
        <li>The original Spiderman Trilogy</li>
        <li>Christopher Nolan's Batman Trilogy</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I really wish it wasn't so hard to access anything in here, but I know
        one day I'll be able to clear my backlog and I'm looking forward to it
        :)
