      <h1>The magic of animation</h1>
      <p>As any other kid I grew up watching cartoons</p>
      <p>And of course, it sparked an interest for animation as a whole</p>
      <p>Arguably my most long lasting hobby, as I still do it today</p>
      <p>
        I would watch any random cartoons on TV, following certain series the
        best I could. Looking back, it actually made me have a sort of a
        schedule so I wouldn't miss anything :D
      </p>
      <p>
        Then someone showed me what anime was, japanese "cartoons". Turned out
        these cartoons would cover a way wider age range and themes
      </p>
      <p>To name some of my favorites:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Naruto - a fantasy setting</li>
        <li>Death Note - a thriller with a fantasy element</li>
        <li>
          Bakuman - a so called "slice of life", a novel about manga creators
          and life
        </li>
        <li>Psycho Pass - a sci-fi dystopia</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The list goes on and like I said, the range and variety of themes was
        amazing. So it grew up with me up until recent years
      </p>
      <h3>Animation's expression</h3>
      <p>
        There's something so unique about animation that in my opinion can't be
        achieved with anything else. The expresiveness, the HUGE variety of
        artstyles, from more "cartoonish" to more realistic, the impossible
        movements, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nowadays I look more into Western and 3D animation, a whole new and
        different perspective for me from Japanese anime
      </p>
      <p>And some of my favorite shows I've discovered:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>RWBY</li>
        <li>
          Avatar The Last Airbender
          <p>
            Which I didn't discover recently, but has been with me for a long
            long time. On the surface made for kids, yet exploring so many
            themes about our world and nature, regarded as one of the best
            pieces of animation ever made
          </p>
          <p>
            Every time I watch it as I grow older, there's a new perspective to
            it :O
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>Arcane</li>
        <li>
          Cyberpunk: Edgerunners
          <p>
            Technically Japanese, based on the Polish videogame Cyberpunk 2077,
            it mixes the two styles in a way
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>And I've also kinda gotten back to some modern cartoons as an adult :D</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Steven Universe</li>
        <li>The Owl House</li>
      </ul>
