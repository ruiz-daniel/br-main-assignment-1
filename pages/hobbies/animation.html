      <h1>The magic of animation</h1>
      <section title="Growing Up with Animation">
        <p>As any other kid I grew up watching cartoons</p>
        <p>And of course, it sparked an interest for animation as a whole</p>
        <p>Arguably my most long lasting hobby, as I still do it today</p>
        <p>
          I would watch any random cartoons on TV, following certain series the
          best I could. Looking back, it actually made me have a sort of a
          schedule so I wouldn't miss anything :D
        </p>
      </section>
      <section title="Anime">
        <p>
          Then someone showed me what anime was, japanese "cartoons". Turned out
          these cartoons would cover a way wider age range and themes
        </p>
        <p>To name some of my favorites:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Naruto - a fantasy setting
            <div>
              <img
                width="150"
                height="200"
                src="../../images/naruto-cover.jpg"
                alt="Naruto cover"
              />
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            Death Note - a thriller with a fantasy element
            <div>
              <img
                width="150"
                height="200"
                src="../../images/death-note-cover.jpg"
                alt="Death Note cover"
              />
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            Bakuman - a so called "slice of life", a novel about manga creators
            and life
            <div>
              <img
                width="150"
                height="200"
                src="../../images/bakuman-cover.jpg"
                alt="Bakuman cover"
              />
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            Psycho Pass - a sci-fi dystopia
            <div>
              <img
                width="150"
                height="200"
                src="../../images/psycho-pass-cover.jpg"
                alt="Psycho Pass cover"
              />
            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The list goes on and like I said, the range and variety of themes was
          amazing. So it grew up with me up until recent years
        </p>
      </section>
      <section title="Animation's expresiveness">
        <h3>Animation's expressiveness</h3>
        <p>
          There's something so unique about animation that in my opinion can't
          be achieved with anything else. The expresiveness, the HUGE variety of
          artstyles, from more "cartoonish" to more realistic, the impossible
          movements, etc.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section title="Nowadays and western animation">
        <p>
          Nowadays I look more into Western and 3D animation, a whole new and
          different perspective for me from Japanese anime
        </p>
        <p>And some of my favorite shows I've discovered:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            RWBY
            <div>
              <img
                width="150"
                height="200"
                src="../../images/rwby-cover.jpg"
                alt="RWBY cover"
              />
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            Avatar The Last Airbender
            <div>
              <img
                width="150"
                height="200"
                src="../../images/avatar-cover.jpg"
                alt="Avatar cover"
              />
            </div>
            <p>
              Which I didn't discover recently, but has been with me for a long
              long time. On the surface made for kids, yet exploring so many
              themes about our world and nature, regarded as one of the best
              pieces of animation ever made
            </p>
            <p>
              Every time I watch it as I grow older, there's a new perspective
              to it :O
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Arcane

                alt="Arcane cover"
              />
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>

                alt="Cyberpunk Edgerunners cover"
              />
            </div>
            <p>
              Technically Japanese, based on the Polish videogame Cyberpunk
              2077, it mixes the two styles in a way
            </p>
