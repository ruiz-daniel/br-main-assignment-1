      <h1>Why I love videogames</h1>
      <p>Ever since I was little, most of my memories are playing games with my dad, cousin and friends</p>
      <p>It quickly became a way to connect with them, and with what would then become my other interests</p>
      <p>Some of the games I remember back then are: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pro Evolution Soccer 2022
          (the game that made me <a href="./football.html">like football</a>)
        </li>
        <li>Gran Turismo</li>
        <li>Tekken 3</li>
      </ul>

      <p>As time went on I fell in love with the medium and its unique way to tell stories, complete challenges and compete with your friends :)</p>
      <p>Nowadays, my favorite games are: </p>

          <li>Nier series</li>
          <li>SMT Devil Survivor</li>
          <li>VA11 Hall-A</li>
          <li>Mass Effect</li>
