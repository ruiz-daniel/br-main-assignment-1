      <h1>Streaming, my favorite passtime</h1>
      <p>
        As someone who lives in a country where the internet took
        <strong>a while</strong>
        to arrive and is
        <strong>yet</strong>
        to catch up to the rest of the world, I was lucky enough to discover
        live streaming platforms a few years ago
      </p>
      <p>
        From creators streaming games, to just chatting, podcasts and D&D shows,
        I quickly found it to be the perfect passtime, whether to have something
        on the background while coding or doing something else, or as a way to
        watch events
