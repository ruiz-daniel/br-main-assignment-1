      <h1>My favorite book series</h1>
      <p>
        There is an anual event in my country called "International Book Expo"
        where books from almost everywhere around the world are sold at
        relatively affordable prices for the general public. Due to multiple
        reasons, is hard, borderline impossible, to officially buy most books
        from international authors here. However this one event offers some
        opportunities
      </p>
      <p>
        When I was a kid my mother would take me there hoping I would get into
        reading
      </p>
      <p>
        And it worked, during my childhood I spent a lot of time reading fantasy
        stories on paper
      </p>
      <p>
        Out of nowhere, I was drawn in by these strange covers of teens turning
        into animals. And that's how I discovered my favorite series: Animorphs,
        by Katherine Applegate
      </p>

      <p>
        A series about a group of teens fighting an alien invasion with the
        power of turning into animals and even aliens. I ended up reading around
        20 to 30 of these for hours and some of them, multiple times
      </p>
      <p>
        One thing I particularly loved about them was the writing in first
        person, making you feel in the mind of each of the characters
      </p>
      <p>
        However the series goes way longer than that and I could never finish
        it. I should probably do it one day, but first I need a way to buy the
        rest of the books -_-
      </p>
      <p>Of course this would take me to read other fantasy books and series</p>
      <p>
        But as time went on, since adquiring books here isn't too easy and my
        other interests arose I became kinda separated from literature as I
        found mainly
        <a href="./videogames.html">videogames</a>
        and
        <a href="./animation.html">animation</a>
        to be more expressive and somehow more accesible here
      </p>
      <p>
        I still consider books an interesting and unique form of art and I hope
        in the future I'll have the time and proper conditions to engage with it
        again. Maybe when I can buy, and more importantly
        <strong>use</strong>, a Kindle :D
