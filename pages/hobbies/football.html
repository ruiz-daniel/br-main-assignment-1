      <h1>My old passion with football and competition</h1>
      <p>
        Football is such a massive sport, that it was a matter of time it caught
        up to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        However it was through playing a
        <a href="./videogames.html">videogame</a>
        , Pro Evolution Soccer 2022, that I became interested in it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I liked the competition, the rivalries, and the game itself. So with my
        friends, from a very early age (7 or so), I started practicing it.
      </p>
      <p>
        It became my main form of socialization, and of keeping myself healthy,
        since the other half of my free time would be dedicated indoors to
        videogames xD. I would often go play after school or during weekends,
        some times til quite late in the afternoon. I also remember gathering
        with friends to watch professional matches, bing a huge fan of AC Milan
        and italian football at the time.

      <p>
        Tho as the possibilities to watch football in my country were limited,
        and after getting into college I didn't have as much time nor the same
        ability to match schedules with my old friends, my interest dwindled and
        nowadays os more like a very nice memory
      </p>
      <p>
        However, once born from videogames, it then mixed with videogames again,
        as my passion for sports went into the internet and to esports;
        competitive gaming
      </p>
      <p>So nowadays I watch a lot of esports tournaments and play many competitive games myself</p>
